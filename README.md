Adapter Pattern for Project 4

In this project, we used the adapter pattern to help create the basics of a fighting game. The adapter is used to ensure that many different types of opponenets can be handled by our code using only one interface. Though this code has only two types of opponent, we could extrapolate to an arbitraty number without changing anything in our source code, simply adding new classes for the new types of enemy.
